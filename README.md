# Thought Process :
1. I wanted to create a simple CRUD application with login, register, and auto-save functionality.
2. I researched a bit and understood that note-saving or script applications are ideal for this kind of project.
3. First, I built the back-end system using Node.js and Express.js along with some more modules such as JWT, Bcrypt, etc.
4. Then I moved to the front-end part. But before that, I selected some colors like primary and secondary colors. Additionally, 
  I created a mental model of the project, which represents how my front-end part is supposed to look like. After all of this, 
  I started building the front-end using React.js, Chakra UI, Redux, etc.
5. After completing the front-end part, I tested my site multiple times and then deployed it.

# Tech Stacks :
Front-end : ReactJS, ChakraUI, Redux, React Router Dom, Axios and Font Awesome.
Back-end : NodeJS, ExpressJS, Mongoose, Json Web Token, Bcrypt, Cors and Dotenv.
Database : MongoDB.

# Clone :
`git clone https://github.com/dgdeepon/blogs_xi.git`
# In side the back-end folder :
1. You have to add your .env file with mongoDB database link.
2. `npm i`.
3. `npm run server`.
# In side the front-end folder :
1. You have to add your .env file with API link.
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run start`
